# Static Analyser - Identifying print/log statements in try blocks

This tool **finds print statements or logs** in Python code that are **created within `try` blocks**. It grew out of a personal habit of keeping print/log statements in try blocks for debugging, and often forgetting to remove them before pushing to production ðŸ˜…. (often happens with [JavaScript](https://github.com/fossunited/fossunited/pull/589#discussion_r1742236197) too)

## Why?

`print()` statements are often added in try blocks for debugging, like in the case of printing the result of computations or status flags. However, these statements are typically not suitable for production environments. Proper logging should be done in `except` blocks once the exception is caught or the `finally` block.

## Includes: 

- Analysing of single Python script files for print/log statements within try blocks
- Modular design for proper extensions and maintenance: 
    - The `StaticAnalyser` class forms the base that carries input and output mechanisms
    - The `PatternIdentifier` forms an abstraction layer. Any new pattern checks can be plugged in here.
- Outputs findings to console or a chosen report file.

## How to Run:

First, clone this repo and add your needed input file to analyse.

**1. To analyse a file:**

```python3 main.py [input_file]```

For example:

```python3 main.py sample_test_file.py```

**2. To save the output to a file:**

```python3 main.py [input_file] -s [report_file]```

or

```python3 main.py [input_file] > [report_file]```

Note: You can use either `-s` or `--save` to specify the report file.

**3. To run tests:**

`python -m unittest test_static_analyser.py`

## Dependencies
There are no external dependencies. It relies heavily on Python's built-in `ast` module for parsing and analyzing Python code.

## Future Extensions

- Detect unwanted `console.log()` statements in JavaScript files.
    - There is a [plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-remove-console) that removes all console calls. However seems, this needs to be directly added into project's workflow, and not be used as a tool.
- Rewrite as a pylint or flake8 plugin with custom rules rather than using `ast` (Hypothesis: makes it more better for integration and maintenance)
- Research and implement additional pattern checks to improve code quality.
    - Considered to make a check for writing tests - checks if tests are done on air-tight environments. 
    - Often this case is violated, and the caching db gets exhausted or corrupted.
